    "In this project, I have applied the concept of deep reinforcement learning on the classic game - Snake. I used the approach called Q-learning, which is based on value functions that estimates the expected return of being in a given state. I extended this approach to deep Q-network and used a convolutional neural network to implement it. Using this approach, the maximum score I could achieve was 7 (seven)."
